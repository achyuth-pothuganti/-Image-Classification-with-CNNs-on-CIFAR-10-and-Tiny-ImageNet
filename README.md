# Image-Classification-with-CNNs-on-CIFAR-10-and-Tiny-ImageNet
This repository contains a comprehensive project on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to the CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. The project explores multiple architectures, including:

**Pre-trained Models:** VGG-16, ResNet.

**Customized CNN Models:** Tailored architectures designed and optimized for the datasets.

**üîç Key Features:**
**Dataset Handling:** Preprocessing and augmentation techniques for CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet.

**Model Implementations:**
  1.VGG-16 and ResNet for leveraging transfer learning.
  
  2. Custom CNN architectures fine-tuned for specific dataset challenges.
  
**Training:**
  1.Experimented with hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
  2. Used advanced techniques like learning rate scheduling and dropout.
  
**Evaluation:**
  Analyzed performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) and visualized results with confusion matrices.
  
  Plotted learning curves to track training and validation performance.
**Comparison:**
Evaluated the strengths and trade-offs of pre-trained models vs. custom CNNs.
